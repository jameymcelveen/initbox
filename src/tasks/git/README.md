**Distributed version control system**

## Overview

- **Branching and Merging**: Lightweight branching allows for easy experimentation
- **Speed**: Most operations are performed locally, making Git extremely fast
- **Data Integrity**: Every file and commit is checksummed with SHA-1
- **Staging Area**: Fine-grained control over what goes into each commit
